## Auth
A lock script that verifies the signature of the witness.

## TODO
This is a dummy script that does not verify the signature. It only checks if the witness is the reverse of the lock script args for demonstration purpose.

It should be replaced with a real signature verification script when ckb-auth [PR](https://github.com/cryptape/ckb-auth/pull/21) is merged.
